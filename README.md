### Welcome to my libASM repository 👋

⭐️ The goal of this subject was to recode few functions in assembly language (64 bits ASM - Intel syntax).

## 💡 Usage

A main file is given in order to test the functions. Feel free to modify it !<br>

```
make
gcc main.c libasm.a
./a.out
```

🔑 The assembly code is compiled with nasm, please install it before ```make```
